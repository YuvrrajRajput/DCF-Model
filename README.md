# Coca-Cola DCF Valuation Model

## Overview
I built this discounted cash flow (DCF) model on The Coca-Cola Company as a way to practice real-world valuation work and deepen my understanding of how mature consumer businesses create value. I wanted to walk through the full process, from gathering historical data to forming assumptions and seeing how they flow into intrinsic value.

The model focuses on forecasting operating performance and estimating unlevered free cash flows. I didn’t build a full three‑statement model; instead, I used balance sheet items only where they were actually needed (mainly for working capital and capex assumptions). This kept the project focused on valuation rather than accounting mechanics.

## Model Structure
The Excel file follows a simple, step‑by‑step layout that mirrors how I approached the analysis:

- Historical financials
- Key forecasting assumptions (growth, margins, capex, working capital)
- Forecasted income statement
- Free cash flow build
- DCF valuation and implied equity value per share

---

## Key Assumptions
These assumptions reflect my interpretation of Coca-Cola’s business model and long-term profile:

- Revenue growth gradually slows over time, given the company’s size and global penetration
- Operating margins stay relatively stable, consistent with historical trends
- Capital expenditures run above depreciation to reflect ongoing reinvestment
- Working capital changes are tied to incremental revenue to smooth out timing noise
- Terminal value uses a conservative perpetual growth rate

## Valuation Methodology
Unlevered free cash flow is calculated as:

EBIT × (1 − Tax Rate)

Plus: Depreciation & Amortization

Less: Capital Expenditures

Less: Change in Net Working Capital

I discounted projected cash flows using WACC to arrive at enterprise value, then adjusted for net debt and shares outstanding to estimate equity value.

## Notes
I completed this project independently as a way to build hands‑on financial modeling experience and get closer to the type of valuation work done in an analyst role. It was a great exercise in connecting the dots between financial statements, assumptions, and valuation outcomes.
